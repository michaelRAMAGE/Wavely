Shifting to production 
-- hide API keys - use lib like dotenv? how about google-services.json?
--- firebase
---- google apis
----- stt api 
----- others used in exporting
-- find server host for server.js (update post urls) - up for discussion
-- follow whatever expo recommends 
-- implement tests and test app  
-- finish conversion to typescript 
--- functions

Remaining features for Minimal Viable Product
- exporting transcripts to places like google docs
- importing transcripts --> add to database

Reversing costs for exceeding free limits on apis
- embed ads? google api for ads?
-- watch ads for additional conversions
- assign cost to product (list as purchasable app)

In the future
- make a web app?
